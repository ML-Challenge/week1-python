# Machine Learning Challenge Week 1: Learnign Python

Python is one of the most widely used programming languages in the industry. It's a powerful, general-purpose language with applications ranging from web development to data science.

In this week's challenge you will learn the basics of Python programming: syntax, variables, functions, conditionals, lists & list comprehensions, loops, strings, and dictionaries, external libraries.

Lessons:

1. **Hello, Python** - a quick introduction to Python syntax, variable assignment, and numbers
2. **Functions and Getting Help** - calling functions and defining our own, and using Python's builtin documentation
3. **Booleans and Conditionals** - using booleans for branching logic
4. **Lists** - lists and the things you can do with them. Includes indexing, slicing and mutating
5. **Loops and List Comprehensions** - for and while loops, and a much-loved Python feature: list comprehensions
